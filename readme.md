I aim to review AWS and CI tools for QA work with a loose goal of creating a pipeline involving LangChain and Telegram, possibly encompassing a complete AWS (and GCP) architecture. This pipeline will run off GitHub Actions and possibly a Jenkins machine. If I create some kind of ML model using the data, such as word counts or embeddings, it will be fantastic.

It doesn't need to be perfect but should cover most of the basics until it gets complex.
